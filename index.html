                Starting my first year at Northwestern, Level I felt daunting. The flood of notes, concepts, and jargon was 
                challenging to navigate and I wasn't sure how they fit together. 
                At the beginning of winter quarter, we were lucky to have Chris Lamb&#8212;the Professor behind Level I&#8212;to explain 
                its structure to us. After that week, I felt confident about where to direct my energy in the practice room. 
                With that in mind, I wanted to share the knowledge I gained from Professor Lamb and organize Level I into
                a site that's easy to understand and navigate. This website solely reflects my understanding of Level I 
                and does not speak for Professors Wu, Lamb, or any other staff&#8212;their word overrides anything that's written here. 
                I hope this site will make your transition into the Northwestern Percussion studio smoother and more enjoyable. 
                Everyone in the studio is so excited to meet you! <br>

        <h2>Bird's Eye View</h2>
            <p id="bird">What is this Level thing? 
                The level system teaches percussion from the ground up. 
                Professor Chris Lamb built this system by curating and combining views from throughout the percussion cannon. 
                The underclassmen are enrolled in Level I, developing foundations of playing; 
                the upperclassmen are enrolled in Level II, applying their knowledge across instruments and styles. 
                For Level I, you will need physical or digital copies of <a href="Books.html">these method books</a>.
                By the end of Level I, you will be able to fluidly execute the vast majority of percussion's musical demands.
                More importantly, you'll know how to teach yourself any technique on any instrument for the rest your musical career.
            </p>
        
        <h2>Common Questions and Concerns</h2>
            <question>Eight whole method books! Do we learn all of them?</question>
            <p>You'll learn lots of notes and techniques in Level I, but you're not expected to learn all eight books cover to cover in six months.
                Instead, you'll focus on a 'survey'&#8212;a boiled down, concentrated selection from each book. 
                <a href="Breakdown.html">Check out the global snare and xylo surveys.</a>
            </p>

            <question>Even with the surveys, this is A LOT of music. How will I remember it all during the technical exam?</question>
            <p>You won't. In fact, Professors Wu and Lamb often actively discourage memorizing Level I material; they
                want you to practice reading music. Instead of memorizing exercises while you learn them&#8212;especially in the Green book&#8212;
                practice reading along on the page and notice common patterns and shapes. The goal is to be familiar with each exercise
                that you can play it cold while reading along on the page.
            </p>

            <question>These method books all have different philosophies. How do they fit together?</question>
            <p>Each method book in Level I develops different skills; together, they create an method of movement and style that is relaxed and highly adaptable. 
                *An important note: the way we use these books differs from, and sometimes directly contradicts, the instructions in the 
                book. For example, in Delecluse Method we play the opening "One Handed Exercises" with alternating strokes and ignore
                Delecluse's instruction to practice the left hand three times more than the right*
                <a href="Tree.html">See how the methods books connect to our big-picture goals.</a>
            </p>

            <question>Is there material outside the books I'll need?</question>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="Level_1_OG.html">The OG documents,</a> these are the core written documents of Level I&#8212;authored by Chris Lamb</li>
                    <li><a href="Key_Solos.html">Collection of Level I xylo and glock solos,</a> pulled from the core documents</li>
                    <li><a href="Snare_Solos.html">Collection of Level I snare solos,</a> pulled from the core documents</li>
                    <li><a href="Aux_Rudiments.html">Rudiments for tambourine, triangle, and cymbals,</a> pulled from the core documents</li>
                    <li><a href="App_Exercises.html">Xylo warmups,</a> previously passed down by rote, now written out </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <question>The whole survey is on snare and xylo. How is that supposed to make me a balanced percussionist?</question>
            <p>Though you'll get very comfortable on snare and xylo, Level I is never just about snare and xylo. The concepts
                you'll learn apply across all percussion instruments and all styles. Once you are an upperclassmen, Level II
                focuses on applying the foundation of Level I across many instruments and styles. More importantly,  
                these lessons will support your growth even if classical percussion isn't your long term goal.   
            </p>

            <question>Will I be evaluated on this content?</question>
            <p>Yes, but the goal of Level I isn't to achieve a passing score like traditional classes. Professors Wu and Lamb don't 
                expect everyone to play each exercise at a certain bpm with perfect accuracy; they want to see everyone growing as players
                and putting in a honest effort towards that growth. During fall and winter quarter, you'll be coached through Level I 
                in masterclasses and private lessons (though the most work will be done in a practice room). At the end of winter quarter,
                you will take the technical exam to check in on your progress.
            </p>

            <question>What is the technical exam?</question>
            <p>Around the end of winter quarter, you will play a selection of Level I exercises for a small panel&#8212;usually Profs Wu 
                and Lamb. You will not know which exercises will be chosen before the exam. This is not a traditional exam; it's 
                closer to an annual checkup. Unlike a traditional exam, you cannot cram for the technical. There are far too many notes to 
                learn and passing is about showing musical growth and maturity. Unlike a traditional exam, you get a chance to improve 
                and try again! In fact, almost every student fails portions of the technical exam. There is a second round called "retakes"
                which are held a little later. During retakes, you retry the exercises you didn't pass during the first technical. 
                If you show you've made progress in those areas, your score will be changed to passing.
            </p>

            <question>I have more questions! What should I do?</question>
            <p>Ask your studiomates! Everyone in our percussion studio has made it through Level I. 
                We're always here to help you out, and if there's something we don't know we can pass your 
                question up to the professors. Profs Wu and Lamb encourage each student to develop their own
                ways of understanding percussion. If you're struggling with something, learning a new perspective 
                can be the key to overcoming that challenge.
            </p>
